- Start copying and pasting code from cloned extension. Don't uncomment the networking code till you've debuged and tested the site loggin system.

    Program Flow
/-------------------------


- Process localStorage for saved serverAddress and port

- First try to connect to the tcpServer
  - If cannot connect, show a notification popup once and try to reconnect in couple of seconds
    - If connected
      - Exchange an handshake message with the electron app. (figure out to sync it with data from c# app in the electron app)
        - If handshake message failed, disonnect
      - Bind your tcpData processing function to the onReceiveData of the tcp-client
      

- No matter if you can connect to tcpServer or not, start logging websites and time spent on them
  - To track time, website url and tabId by binding your  function to chrome.onActivated event
  - To track the end time of the said website and tabId bind your function to chrome.onRemoved or whatever




/-------------------------
    Data Objects
/-------------------------

- Data Object for each log
  {
  serialNo/tabId_for_the_session: maybe,
  startTime: preferably UNIX time,
  endTime: preferably UNIX time. NULL if tab still open. The value should be replaced with current UNIX
            time if the value is NULL and 3rd party app requests for new log,
  url: url of the website,
  }

- localStorage stuff
   localStorage.tcpServerAddress
   localStorage.tcpServerPort
   localStorage.logJSON
   localStorage.MaxEntries ? (Maybe if you wanna only keep like 200 values in logJSON)
